These notes contains my raw thoughts, insights, and intuitions about AI

Right now, using AI feels like a big deal - you open ChatGPT or Claude, type something, and think "wow, I'm talking to an AI!"
But according to andrej karpathy,  AI will become invisible background technology, just like electricity. You don't think "wow, I'm using electricity!" when you flip a light switch - you just expect it to work.
In the future:

AI will be quietly running inside all our apps and devices
we'll pay based on how much we use it (like your electric bill)
we'll only notice it when it breaks or goes down
Companies will watch their "AI costs" the same way they watch their electricity bills today
Eventually it'll become so common and cheap that it's just basic infrastructure

Basically, AI will go from being this exciting new thing to being boring background plumbing that everything depends on - which is actually a sign that the technology has become truly successful.
